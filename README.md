# CoffeeScript Adventure

This repository contains a bunch of stuff I've recently uncovered about CoffeeScript with other JavaScript libraries. I will update this frequently as I move on. Feel free to share some tips if you have.

## Introduction

My purpose is to simply be able to document all the things I've learned in CoffeeScript in the hopes that it might help others. If you think that something is debatable or can be improved, please do not hesitate to make a pull request.
